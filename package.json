You'll be able to see there work and look at reviews and ratings of artists by other users. Tattoo shops and their locations will be diplayed as well, and viewing the shops page will show all artists associated with them. The final product is for someone hoping to get a tattoo, but doesnt have a relationship with an artist they love. So they'll be able to browse Inkwell and find artists that specialize in a style they like. *** ## Getting Started *** ## Updates ***",
